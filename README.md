# SBI-SRIM

Exploring **simulation-based inference (SBI)** methods applied to ion-solid interactions modeled with **SRIM (Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter)**.  

This repo contains Jupyter notebooks and prototype pipelines for:  
- Running SRIM simulations and extracting lattice vacancy data  
- Using SBI techniques to infer ion energies from summary statistics  
- Building basic pipelines as a foundation for future quantum sensing applications
